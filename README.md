# Fingerprint-Attendance-System
With the existence of the proposed system, it would be helpful for authority to record students’ attendance. The system consists of three processes – enrollment, attendance and
data storage. First of all, all the students have to enroll their fingers. The fingerprint of a student is captured and its unique features called minutiae points extracted using
crossing number method and stored in internal memory of fingerprint module with the student’s identity as a template. During attendance, the fingerprint of the student is captured
again and the extracted features compared with the template in the fingerprint database to determine a match before attendance is made. If fingerprints are not matched, the system
will show a message ‘Finger not found’. Two persons’ fingers are not similar. So, the students will never give attendance for their friends. If a match is found, the student is
allowed for the lecture. It facilitates access to the attendance of a particular student in a particular class. For further purpose, the attendance details are stored in a file
with the help of SD card module. Then from the excel sheet, all the calculations will be done.

The overall system is a reliable and secured system. It is easy to use. It cannot be forged easily. From manually marking the attendance in attendance registers to using biometric systems, 
the overall system has been improved significantly.
